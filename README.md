# Lecture-Take

#### 01. Brief Description of Project - Lecture-Take is an app that allows students to save references during a lecture. For example in DSA if there is a need to have a look on quick sort algorithm the user can type and save Quicksort - Pg 10 and title as DSA with a picture of the lectures explanation on the board. There by the student can have a later look on what he needs to focus more on that particular lecture. Further all local news is also being displayed from my api available @ rapid api 
#### 02. Users of the System - Students
#### 03. What is unique about your solution - It's a one stop for students and unlike other note taking apps goodnotes my app is mainly focused on saving the reference for a later look and with the transcribe functionality the student can also transcribe on what the lecturer is saying.
